# Towers of Hanoi example

This is an implementation of the Towers of Hanoi example for recursion.

## The implementation in the main branch is incomplete!

It contains two little exercises: 
implement the toString() and size() methods in Tower.Node recursively.

The branch [complete_implementation](https://github.com/htw-imi-info2/su09-recursion/tree/complete_implementation)
contains a possible solution.
